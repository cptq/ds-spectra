Code by Derek Lim accompanying paper "The Doubly Stochastic Single Eigenvalue Problem: A Computational Approach" by Derek Lim, Charles R. Johnson.

## Make
`make init` uses pip to install requirements as found in `requirements.txt`

`make test` runs the test suite

## Scripts
The functions to compute $DS_n$ or search for exceptions to the Perfect-Mirsky conjecture are included in `permhull.py`.

## Plots
